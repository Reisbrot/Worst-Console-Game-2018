Good, there should be a Unit Sytem. I came to this, after I tried to make some shit with the Reisbrot.
Lol.

Quick Ref is this Table. Everything else is not very important. It just hangs around.

Einheit  Groesse  Implemented

Energy   FOPS     No
Weight   Gram     No
Length   Metre    No
Hardness Mohs     No
Temp.    Celsius  No
Time     Seconds  No
Speed    m/s      No
Accele.  m/s^2    No
Part     percent  No



So, I guess Ill implement one standard Energy-Unit (Food, Physics, etc.) like Joule or stuff
But I wont call it Joule
Ill call it:::: Waiiiit
Ill call it >>FOPS<<

One Item is the amount of its weight. So, if Ive got a half Reisbrot, its 0,5 of itself.
At weight, I guess Weight will get something normal,
Ill call it >>ElectronVolts JOKJOKEJOKE its just >>Gram<<<<

So. Length and Stuff is >>Metres<<, since its easy and stuff

Hardness is from 1 to 10, with like 2 decimal points, after the https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A4rte#Mohs >>Mohs hardness scale<<.
Hardness will determine how Items interact with the "Scene", the player and other Items. If you throw it, if you want to change it, etcetera.

What else do we have? Smell is defined in the Smell class. lol
Umm - --  - Auw Right temperature is in good ol >>Celsius<<, cause wtf Kelvin its like Kevin no
racism but what ever >>Â°C<< dito.

TIMEEEE:
Since time is only an integer, its in >>Seconds<<. I guess thats precise enough.
Time is NOT linear, means laws of relativity are a real thing here!
Wait I have to find a formula.. oh for that i need Accelation and Speed first.

Lets see..
Speed is in >>Metres per Second<<, since those are the standard Units, and
Acceleartion is also SI-Conform, so its >>Meters per Second squared<<, so if I
would take a Acc. of like 10, in 2 seconds it would be 20meters per second
faster.

Soo now back to relativity: 
For every metre you move faster, the things around you will happen a millionth 
of a second slower. LOLZ. Not implemented yet I guess. I dont know. But i guess.

Symptoms, like from food, are effects to biological things. For example, if a
symptom is diarrhea, you have to shit more and youll need more nutrients.
And the stuff in your shit is different. And you arent able to do as much as
normally. That kind of stuff are symptoms. The overdose amount is in gram.
So if you take 1 Reisbrot for example, youll eat its weight property worth of weight
or so lol i no god englisch menn.

content is in >>percent<<

>>>(I didnt mention i guess, OF COURSE THE UNITS WILL GET FORMATTED FOR THE PLAYER)<<<
